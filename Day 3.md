# Structured Programming in C
Preprocessor Constants - Defining constants
Using constants instead of numbers are clearer
* adds to a program's readability
* allows a program to be more easily modified

# Expressions vs Statements
## Expressions
sequences of tokes that can be evaluated to a numerical quantity
* can be a single number
* can be an identifier
* can be more complicated sequence of tokens
* can contain any of the operators in C
* arguments to functions

## Statement
* sequence of tokens terminated with a semicolon that can be rec by compiler

# lvalue vs rvalue expressions
*Is it on the left or right*

An expression ca nboth an lvalue and a rvalue

# Assignment Expression

# Blocks and Compound Statements

# Logical Operators and Expressions
C only eval as much as necessary to determine truth val

*sigh* she's talking about a short-circuit &&

# Precedence of the Logical Operators
$\begin{aligned}
3x = 6 \\
10x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0
\end{aligned}$
