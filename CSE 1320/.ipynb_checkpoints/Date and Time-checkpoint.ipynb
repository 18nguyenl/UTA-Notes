    "  * meant 32-bit `uint` could only represent a span of time < 829 days\n",
    "* for this reason, time is represented by number 0 (called the *epoch*) had to be set in very recent past\n",
    "  * this was early 1970s\n",
    "  * the epoch was set to 1971-1-1\n",
    "* Later system time changed to increment every second, which increased span of time that could be represented w/ 32-bit `uint` to around 136 years\n",
    "  * since it no longer important to sqeeze every second out of counter, counter was rounded down the nearest decade becoming 1970-1-1\n",
    "* one must assume this was considered a bit neater than 1971-1-1\n",
    "* note that 32-bit *signed* integer using 1970-1-1 as its epoch can reprsent dates up to 2038-1-19 on which date it will wrap around to 1901-12-13"
